# PetitionWeb

The project is a web site for petitions to be added and signed before a due date.

The project is using PHP and SQL for the server-side.
Bootstrapp is used for the templating and the representation of the web pages.

The petitions can be ordered, searched by certains characters and be added when authenticated.
The urgent petitions will be shown in the front page and past petitions can be visible but cannot be signed anymore.
A goal of signatures can be assigned for the petitions.
